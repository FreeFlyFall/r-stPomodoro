# rustPomodoro
Pomodoro timer written in Rust

Enter times for work, break, and long break, in minutes - and the number of iterations before the long break time activates, separated by spaces.

e.g. "55 5 25 3" to work for 55 minutes for 3 cycles with a 5 min break, followed by 1 cycle with a 25 minute break
