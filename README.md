# rustPomodoro
Pomodoro timer written in Rust

Enter times for work, break, and long break in minutes, and the number of iterations before the long break time activates, separated by spaces.

e.g. "1h45 15 30 3" to work for 1 hour 45 minutes with a 15 min break, and a 30 minutes break after 3 cycles.
